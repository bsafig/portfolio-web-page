# Personal Portfolio Website

🚀 **Live at:** [https://ben.safigan.com](https://ben.safigan.com)

This is a responsive, portfolio-style website I built to showcase my background, technical skills, resume, and personal projects. It also served as a practical exercise in modern web development — combining front-end technologies with hosting and deployment tools.
